# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Peer graded course project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".

The dataset used is found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The code will only work if all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analyses in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called avg_data.txt, and is uploaded in the course project's form and in this repository.
